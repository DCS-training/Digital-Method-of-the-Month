## Intro

Relational Databases collect information in a structured way and enforce relationships about what goes in and out. This provides additional control over editing processes and will reduce data entry time and errors. In a relational database, data in a table can be related according to keys or concepts. Relationships are a logical connection between different tables and are defined based on the interaction among the tables.

## When do you need a Database

Not all research projects require a database. However there are a series of data characteristics that suggest that building a database would be a good idea.

If you would answer yes to two or more of the following questions, it may be a good idea to look into relational databases:

- Does more than one person have to do data entry at the same time?
- Do you often find yourself copy/pasting data in your spreadsheet?
- Do you usually have more than one tab/spreadsheet open and often have to move data from one to the other?
- Do you have so much data that it is difficult to manage?
- Do you sometimes discover data entry errors and wonder how/when they happened?

## Time

- How much will it take to learn?
- Is it possible to self-learn?


## Easy Pitfalls

- Processing times
- Learning curve
- Form Data entry vs direct data entry


## Type and Software

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) Different open interface available e.g. [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) or [SQLite Studio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/)
- [Access](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/access)
