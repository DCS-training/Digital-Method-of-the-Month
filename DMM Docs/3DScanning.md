## Intro

3D Scanning is the action of recording and analysing three-dimensional data concerning objects and places. The usual outcome is a 3D model that can then be further processed.

The methodologies available are different and work on different principles and they have quite different costs both for what concern time and machines needed. Additionally, depending on the target you aim to shoot certain techniques can be better than others. E.g. if your target is under water you will have to use sonograms or photogrammetry while laser scanners will not work.

#
## Time

- How much will it take to learn?
- Is it possible to self-learn?

#
## Easy Pitfalls

- Processing times
- Learning curve
- On-site processing vs postprocessing
- Storage Space
- Processing power
- Principles vs using a machine/software

#
## Software

Every piece of equipment will come with its propriety software but there are a series of processing software you may want to get accustomed with

- MeshLab: Open-source tool for processing 3D data
- Metashape (Previously PhotoScan) - Propriety software to do SfM
- Python Photogrammetry Toolbox - Open software to do SfM
- 3DF Zephyr - Propriety software to do SfM
- Blender - 3D modelling Open software


## What should I choose?

Below are a series of factors you may want to consider before deciding which technology to adopt

- **Target** (Scale, precision, logistics)
- **Resources** (Money and equipment eventually available)
- **Times** (On-site and postprocessing)
- **Level of customisation** (Some tools are easier to use than others)

**CDCS LIVE UPCOMING TRAINING**

- **15 March: Introduction to Photogrammetry with the Arago Photogrammetric Rig.** [https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/intro-photogrammetry-arago-rig](https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/intro-photogrammetry-arago-rig)
- **20 - 27 March** (2 sessions)**: Digital Drawing with AutoCAD** [https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/digital-drawing-autocad-SS24](https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/digital-drawing-autocad-SS24)
- **25 March - 1 April** (2 sessions): **Recording 3D Data: Lidar Scanner Tutorials.**  Learn how to operate the University of Edinburgh&#39;s BLK360 LIDAR scanners. The two sessions will cover set up and data capture, convert raw LIDAR scan data into point cloud format for use in a range of post-processing and analysis software.

**OTHER LIVE TRAINING WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY**

- Maker Studio has a series of training available [https://www.ucreatestudio.is.ed.ac.uk/list-makerspace-events](https://www.ucreatestudio.is.ed.ac.uk/list-makerspace-events)
- Certain schools will have active training on photogrammetry (e.g. HCA and Geoscience) but will be unlikely open to externals

**TOOL AVAILABLE VIA THE UNIVERSITY**

- **Metashape License** basic available on certain Laptops advanced need approval and come with fees [https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/software/staff-students](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/software/staff-students)
