## Introduction

According to Prof. Dr. Shravan Vasishth:

> Statistics and hypothesis testing are routinely used in areas that are traditionally not mathematically demanding. In such fields, many researchers tend to rely on commercial packages to carry out statistical data analysis, often without understanding the logic of the statistical tests they rely on. As a consequence, results are often misinterpreted, and users have difficulty in flexibly applying techniques relevant to their own research.

Being able to simulate data allows you to:

- enhance your understanding of statistical concepts
- analyse complex data that does not meet the assumptions of standard statistical tests
- create reproducible examples when your data is too big or confidential to share
- conduct power and sensitivity analyses before collecting data
- prepare analysis scripts ahead of [pre-registration](https://github.com/DCS-training/Digital-Method-of-the-Month/blob/main/DMM%20Docs/Preregistration.md).

## Time

- It can take a while to figure out what parameters you actually need to simulate
- Running simulations often frontloads a lot of the hard thinking and coding
- Big simulations can take a while to run depending on what computer/server you're using

## Easy pitfalls

- Fear of maths!
- Conflating what 'power' is in this context
- Understanding data generation processes
- Not having clear hypotheses or research questions
- Additional time commitment throughout your workflow

## Software

For simulation, we would recommend either R or Python.

- In R, there is a family of functions for every distribution, one of which allows you to generate random data from that distribution e.g. ``rbinom`` (binomial distribution), ``rnorm`` (normal distribution), ``runif`` (uniform distribution). The [``faux`` package](https://debruine.github.io/project/faux/) also contains some pre-made functions to help you simulate different kinds of study design (e.g. between vs. within-subjects).
- In Python, the ``scipy.stats`` library contains a family of functions for every distribution, including the ``rvs`` function to generate random data from that distribution. The built-in ``random`` module also contains functions for some simple simulation methods e.g. random sampling, random shuffling, random number generation, and random choices from a list.

In both languages, the packages described above are purpose built for simulation and therefore are made to be **quick** and **efficient**.
