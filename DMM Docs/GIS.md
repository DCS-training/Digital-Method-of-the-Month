## Intro

The use of GIS in humanities and social science projects is a long-established practice.

Using a GIS system can help to create better analysis of studied interactions and phenomena. Maps are able to bring together different informative layers generating additional knowledge where the informative potential exceeds the sum of the single information.

GIS can also help a researcher cross disciplinary boundaries when working on an interdisciplinary project or question. The use of GIS platform can be synthesised into 4 steps:

- _Create_ geographic data.
- _Manage_ it.
- _Analyze_ it and gather a better knowledge of the area as a whole system
- _Display_ it on a map.

## Concept to get familiar with

- Raster vs Vector
- Cartography principles and RS
- Shapefiles and the other vectorial extensions (e.g., .dxf)
- Spatial analysis algorithms
- OSM and WMS services
- Databases
- Image processing: NDVI, DEM and others
- Topology
- Extensions and Plugins

## Time

- How much will it take to learn?
- Is it possible to self learn?

## Easy Pitfalls

- Chose the wrong RS or failing to set a RS.
- Topology errors (mostly if importing data from other systems as CAD)
- Move Project on different PC or moving files from their original location to another.
- Proprietary extensions of files

## The Big Questions

- GIS vs WebGIS
- Implementation with other software (R, Python, 3D managing software, CAD, photogrammetry software)
- How to work collaboratively
- Managing 3D Data

## Softwares

Two main players:

- QGis
- ArcGis

## Resources To Learn GIS

Like a lot of other methods, the things you could wish to learn are many and potentially neverending. Rather than try to learn everything a good pathway for learning is to start from getting familiar with the basics and then google/search specific training on some aspect that you want to develop more
