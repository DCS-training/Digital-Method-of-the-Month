Preregistration is simply that you specify your research plan (i.e., design + analysis), as detailed as possible, in advance of your study and submit it to a registry (e.g., OSF). This clearly distinguishes confirmatory and exploratory research - both of which are important but should not be tested simultaneously using the same data. By addressing this through planning using preregistration, you improve the credibility and transparency of your research.

**Biases and reproducibility issues in science**

- An article in the Guardian: [Trust in science would be improved by study pre-registration](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/jun/05/trust-in-science-study-pre-registration)
- [Publication bias in the social sciences: Unlocking the file drawer](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6203/1502) The authors find a strong bias toward statistically significant findings in reported outcomes, even within a body of work where methodology and rigor did not vary.
