## Intro

&quot;A data visualization first and foremost has to accurately convey the data. It must not mislead or distort. If one number is twice as large as another, but in the visualization they look to be about the same, then the visualization is wrong. At the same time, a data visualization should be aesthetically pleasing. Good visual presentations tend to enhance the message of the visualization. If a figure contains jarring colors, imbalanced visual elements, or other features that distract, then the viewer will find it harder to inspect the figure and interpret it correctly&quot;.

## Concept to get familiar with

- Principle of good data visualisation (clarity/accuracy/reproducibility)
- Languages
- [Libraries](https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-are-libraries-in-coding)
- Start coding
- Code structure and etiquette

## Time

- How much will it take to learn?
- Is it possible to self learn?

## Easy Pitfalls

- Wrong graph
- Misleading charts
- Miscommunicating your model/research
- Overkilling
- Lack of units of measurments

## Easy Pitfalls of coding

- [Understanding what are you saving and where (Project/working directory/notebooks)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/working-directory)
- Overwrite code
- Multiple variables with the same name

## What data visualisation can offer
- Customisability.
- Exploration and verification of your research.
- Clear communication of your research.
- Creativity to your presentations.
- Interactive designs (when using software such as shiny, Tableau or powerBI).

## Software/Languages

- Python
- R and R studio

Non coding options
- For Networking visualisation: [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), [The Vistorian](https://vistorian.github.io/)
- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb), [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/), [Gale Digital scholar Lab](https://go.gale.com/ps/start.do?p=DSLAB&u=ed_itw)
- [Comparison of main non-coding options](https://www.toptal.com/designers/data-visualization/data-visualization-tools)

## Where to start

Like a lot of other methods, the things you could wish to learn are many and potentially neverending. Rather than try to learn everything a good pathway for learning is to start from getting familiar with the basics and then google/search specific training on some aspect that you want to develop more

**R**

- [https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) This is a collection of cheatsheets about the different aspects of R. They are very useful to quickly find what you need and fix any issue on the fly
- [https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/07/a-big-list-of-the-things-r-can-do.html](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/07/a-big-list-of-the-things-r-can-do.html)
- [(https://simplystatistics.org/2019/03/13/10-things-r-can-do-that-might-surprise-you/)](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2019-03-13-10-things-r-can-do-that-might-surprise-you/#:~:text=10%20things%20R%20can%20do%20that%20might%20surprise,and%20pull%20data%20with%20dplyr%2Fdbplyr%20...%20More%20items)
- Collection of E-Books on different aspects of R[https://bookdown.org/](https://bookdown.org/)
- For web applications and interactive data visualisation there is the [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) application in R.  
- About increasing the amount of work you can do with R in a given amount of time. [https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)
- This book cover the basics of the R principles for Data Science [https://r4ds.had.co.nz/](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- The following chapter provides an overview of all the ways ggplot and the tidyverse can facilitate your data vis needs with R[(https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) ](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html).
- This is a good book on R but also general concepts: https://socviz.co/

**Python**

- If you&#39;re completely new to python, you might find this helpful. It is a comprehensive wiki site with different kinds of ways of starting to program with python (with links to courses, tutorials and websites, and videos): [https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)
- If you are already familiar with programing, here is a guide to downloading python and picking an IDE or a text editor that might suit your needs: [https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)
- You can download python here: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
- This is a free ebook (which corresponds to a free online course): [https://www.py4e.com/html3/](https://www.py4e.com/html3/). It will take you from a beginner level to data visualisation.
- This is a good introduction to some of the libraries and how to use them: [https://towardsdatascience.com/your-everyday-cheatsheet-for-pythons-matplotlib-c03345ca390d](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-everyday-cheatsheet-for-pythons-matplotlib-c03345ca390d).
