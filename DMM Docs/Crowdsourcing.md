## Introduction

Crowdsourcing involves obtaining work, information, or opinions from a large group of people who submit their data via the internet, social media, and smartphone apps. People involved in crowdsourcing sometimes work as paid freelancers, while others perform small tasks voluntarily.

Crowdsourcing differs from traditional methods because you can collect a very large amount of data in (usually) a very short amount of time, all from the comfort of your own home/office.

Examples of research data that can be crowdsourced include:

- Behavioural experiments
- Surveys/questionnaires
- Annotation tasks (e.g. for machine learning)
- Translation tasks (e.g. for language learning resources)
- Mapping tasks (e.g. for crisis response)
- Medical screening (e.g. home blood/saliva testing kits)

## Pros and cons

The benefits of crowdsourcing your research data include:

- For human data, easier access to diverse populations or niche demographic characteristics
- Increased speed and scale of data collection
- Potential cost savings if you don't have to travel to collect data
- Data can be collected by people who are more embedded in the community it comes from

The downsides of crowdsourcing your research data include:

- Less control e.g. demographic characteristics are self-reported, no idea what environment people are in, no opportunity to clarify instructions
- Data quality can be an issue
- For human data, higher exclusion/attrition rate than with in-person data collection
- Potentially *more* expensive if you have to pay fees to an online platform

## Will crowdsourcing work for you?

Crowdsourcing platforms are best used for methodologies that are not negatively impacted if participants become distracted. Attention checks can be used to determine if participants are attending to study materials. 

Crowdsourcing platforms are not well suited for collecting rich, qualitative data, because workers typically attempt to complete studies quickly, as their income can depend upon completing as many studies as possible. 

If particular demographic characteristics are important, you should consider that some workers might be dishonest about their demographic characteristics in order to fit recruitment criteria e.g. it's very common for people to lie about being native English speakers!

## Easy pitfalls

- Balancing task difficulty
- Quality/clarity of instructions
- Relying on people's internet connections/hardware
- Not making things smartphone-friendly
- Informed consent and data protection
- Ethical considerations e.g. rate of pay

## Resources

There are a variety of platforms you can use to host your study and recruit people to take part. The most common ones are:

- [**Amazon Mechanical Turk:**](https://www.mturk.com/) The original big name, but becoming less and less popular in academic circles. Very simple studies can be hosted directly, but it's more common to link to an external tool.
- [**Prolific:**](https://www.prolific.com/) Designed specifically for academic research, and probably the most popular right now. Doesn't provide any tools to host studies; only a platform for recruiting and paying workers.
- [**Gorilla:**](https://gorilla.sc/) Integrates study design and participant recruitment with a very flexible drag-and-drop experiment builder (no coding required) to make very aesthetically pleasing tasks including complex gamification. Run by academic researchers specifically for research. Options for personalised support and custom solutions.
- [**Testable:**](https://www.testable.org/) Integrates study design and participant recruitment. Much more flexible study design than MTurk with a drag-and-drop interface (no coding required), but not as visually exciting as Gorilla (better for surveys).
- [**Qualtrics:**](https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/) Similar to [Survey Monkey](https://uk.surveymonkey.com/), [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/), [Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/) etc. but with more flexible logic/methodology. No participant recruitment, just a place to host your study; you'll have to distribute it yourself.
