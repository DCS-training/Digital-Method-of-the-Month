## Introduction

Network analysis is helpful in revealing patterns within constellations of relations between entities, which can be highly complex and are often hidden in research data. These patterns, however, can prove to be important latent factors and, therefore accrue high heuristic value in research. Network analysis and visualisation tools and techniques provide an interesting approach to empirical (relational) data from a new angle: that of relations in a highly abstract sense of the term, which can thus be applied to many different things. Linguistic descriptions and our ability to understand complex relational constellations quickly reach their limit when we want to integrate the full relational picture. Network analysis and visualisations can help to transform empirical complexity into a research object, allowing exploration and communication of complex relational phenomena.


## Possible uses

Networks are defined by nodes (entities) and edges (relations). In the context of social research, we often associate nodes with humans that are connected by all sorts of relations -- the edges. However, the abstract nature of a network approach means that any connected entities may be researched using network analysis techniques. Relations between characters in a plot can be traced by their interaction patterns, textual documents within a corpus by the co-presence of keywords, actors staring together in a film, companies operating in the same areas, words with semantic similarity, etc. This flexible tool can thus be adapted to specific research interests, strategies and methods, which will define what counts as a node and what counts as an edge.

Networks can be extracted from distinct data formats and refer to relations between entities (people, words, organisations, places, etc.). Network data extraction can be derived from direct observation in natural settings. In this case, researchers may trace networks between research subjects within the physical space where the interaction takes place (e.g., networks of engagement or friendship). Another example can be the use of manual qualitative data analysis (QDA) methods to analyse texts in documents or interview transcriptions.

## Time and Learning

Depends on how deep you want to go. Some techniques and tools are quite straightforward and provide user-friendly graphical user interfaces.

## Where to start

The first important step is to ponder how network analysis may be an apt method for addressing particular research interests. If the focus is around nuanced and textured accounts that cannot be easily reduced to nodes and connections, it may be better to avoid this method. Network analysis is similar to questionnaire research in the sense that it requires formalising and operationalising concepts into indicators which can be turned into very concrete variables. In questionnaire research, the variables operationalise concepts and indicators as concrete questions and associated answers. In network analysis, the research concepts and the indicators are operationalised as entity variables (nodes) and the connections between them (edges).

Interactive frameworks for network analysis and visualisation such as Gephi enable intuitive exploration of the relations we call networks. The highly interactive quality of Gephi makes it perfect for uncovering hidden and complex patterns and structures that emerge from the data.

## Concept to get familiar with

- Edge characteristics

o Directional or unidirectional networks: is node 1 connecting to node 2 but not the other way around?

o Weights: how strong is the connection between the nodes

- Centrality measures (nodes)

o Degree centrality: number of edges linked to each node (popularity, well connected)

o Betweenness centrality: the number of times a node is on the shortest path between other nodes (bridges, gatekeepers)

o Closeness centrality: closeness or distance to other nodes in the network (how far from all others)

o EigenCentrality: similar to degree centrality, but takes into account the centrality of the nodes it's connected to

o PageRank: similar to EigenCentrality, but also takes into account the weight and direction of the edges

## Easy Pitfalls

The abstraction process required for reducing complex social realities to simplified relations between entities will always omit the particularities of (integrating what is very different in chains of equivalence, material constraints, embodied experience, context, etc.).

Network data may quickly become too *big* to process. The increasing availability of connected digital material means it's easy to ingest data that may require a lot of memory and processing power to analyse and visualise.
