## Intro

**AutoCAD** is considered the main software for vector drawing. Although other CAD drawing software are available on the market or as open source, AutoCAD's extensive toolbox is unmatched at present.

**Inventor** is also part of the Autodesk software suite, and is industry standard for engineering CAD. It is excellent at creating complex precision three-dimensional drawings, with the capability of deriving an impressive array of engineering drawings in 2D.

## Possible Uses

### AutoCAD

- 2D Vector drawing / surveying (also on raster bases)
- Generating quantitative information from vector geometries
  - 'Properties', measuring and quoting commands
- 3D modelling

### Inventor

- Drawing 3D object with many component parts
- Drawings and handling data for 3D printing
- Creating professional 2D schematics from 3D data

## Cons
- Autodesk software is expensive (the free to academic staff and students)
- **AutoCAD** is a complex and sometimes discouraging software due to the number of commands, options…as well as some pitfalls (below)
- **Inventor** is comparatively more intuitive but is still a vast programme which will take time to learn (see next).

## Time and learning

### AutoCAD

- There are about 30 essential commands covering 95% of what you need to know.
- AutoCAD: CDCS workshops (Slides of the 2021/2022 workshop available on demand)
- There is an extensive video library of YouTube tutorials available.

### Inventor

The time it takes to learn to use Autodesk Inventor for your purposes really depends on what you are trying to do, and how much experience you have with other CAD software. **If you have a straightforward 3D printing project, then you will be able to get up and running very quickly** but other software may be more appropriate (_e.g.,_ SketchUp, Blender, FreeCAD _etc._).

Inventor excels at working with reference data, and at drawing complex composite objects. **This may take many hours (c.30hrs) of study before you can produce usable work,** but there is an excellent tutorial built into the software and web searches will lead you to rich community knowledge in online forums and video tutorials.

## Avoiding major pitfalls 

### AutoCAD

- Snaps, Dynamic Mode and Polar Mode (bottom bar): make good use of them!
- Layers: manage them carefully.
- Remember to always use Polylines to create customised polygons and be sure to properly close them (type 'CL'; to close).
- When working 3D, modify your UCS (coordinate system) to change your axes (x, y, z) + familiarise with 3D Polyline.
- Regularly save your draft (set an autosave time in Options).

### Inventor

It is worth taking to built-in tutorials as far as you feel able as pure learning by doing can teach bad habits which create problems which only become visible later. Though somethings mistakes have to be made in order to realise the importance of certain procedures, don't beat yourself up if you make mistakes.

I also highly advise working with an external computer mouse (opposed to a touch pad on a laptop). This will make your work much faster.

## Common questions

- Can I interface AutoCAD with QGIS?
- Exporting in .dxf format.
- Importing the .dxf in QGIS > Line to Polygons > Set transformation to georeference (Move – Scale – Rotate).

## Where to turn next

There is an upcoming training on Autocad [https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/digital-drawing-with-autocad](https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/digital-drawing-with-autocad) and [https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/designing-handling-3d-data-printing](https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/designing-handling-3d-data-printing)

The best way to learn them is to get your hands dirty!

As a student you can download both **AutoCAD** and **Inventor** here:

[https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview)

Use the built in help and tutorial features, and for more specific cases search for help online in forums and video tutorials.
