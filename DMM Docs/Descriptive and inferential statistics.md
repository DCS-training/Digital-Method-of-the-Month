## Introduction

**Statistics** is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. Statistics is widely used in scientific disciplines and more and more often in Humanities and Social sciences. However, the difference in the datasets and questions typically part of the latter research calls for some additional caution on using it. Broadly statistics can be divided into two main branches **Descriptive Statistics** and **Inferential Statistics.**

### Key Concepts for today

-   [Descriptive Statistics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp)

    -   Descriptive statistics are used to summarize a given data set. This can either be a representation of the entire population or a sample of a population.

    -   Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread). Measures of central tendency include the mean, median, and mode.

    -   Measures of variability include standard deviation, variance, minimum and maximum variables, [kurtosis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kurtosis.asp), and [skewness](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/skewness.asp).

-   [Inferential Statistics](https://conjointly.com/kb/inferential-statistics/)

    -   *Inferential statistics* is used to suggest explanations for a situation or phenomenon.

    -   It allows for conclusions based on extrapolations, and so is fundamentally different from descriptive statistics.

    -   Note that inferential statistics usually suggest but cannot absolutely prove an explanation or cause-and-effect relationship.

    -   Often inferential statistics help to draw conclusions about an entire population by looking at only a sample of the population.

    -   Inferential statistics often involves estimation and hypothesis testing.

## Time

-   How much will it take to learn?
-   Is it possible to self-learn?

## Easy Pitfalls

-   Not knowing your dataset well
-   [Know your sample size expectations](https://quantitudepod.org/s4e13-power/) - Do you have the power?
-   [What to do with a small sample - Is it always a problem?](https://quantitudepod.org/s2e25-options-for-small-samples/)
-   What to do with missing data?
-   Learning curve
-   Not having a pre-set of questions - beware of accidental p-hacking/cherry picking.
-   [Know the limitations of p values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q)
-   Statistical significance vs meaningful significance.
-   Not knowing the limitation of the method/dataset, e.g. many tests works on normally distributed, independent samples.
-   Working with Likert measures.
-   [Reporting conventions](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures).
-   [Correlation is not causation](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) (But it can be sometimes!)

## Software

Depending on the type of analysis you are going to conduct, there are different software you can use to facilitate it

-   Excel (not a good idea, but if you need to calculate summarising stats quickly, it will be easy to use)
-   [SPSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS) (Easy interface - but will misspecify categorical variables as numeric for regression analyses)
-   [R and R Studio](https://bookdown.org/mikemahoney218/LectureBook/basic-statistics-using-r.html)
-   [Python and SciPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciPy)
