## Intro

According to [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/supporting-healthy-research-and-innovation-culture/open-research/):

> Open research, also widely referred to as open science, relates to how research is performed and how knowledge is shared based on the principle that research should be as open as possible. It also enables research to take advantage of digital technology.
>
> Transparency, openness, verification and reproducibility are important features of research and innovation. Open research helps to support and uphold these features across the whole lifecycle of research â€“ improving public value, research integrity, re-use and innovation.
>
> Open research also helps to support collaboration within and across disciplines. It is integral to a healthy research culture and environment.
>
> All of this is underpinned by open research policies, practices and procedures that support those undertaking research. They raise awareness of expected standards and behaviours and promote wider systems changes for the benefit of the whole community.


## Concepts to get familiar with

- [Open Access (OA) publication](https://pplsopenresearch.github.io/docs/guides/oa_pub.html)
- [Licensing](https://pplsopenresearch.github.io/docs/guides/licensing.html)
- [Open data](https://pplsopenresearch.github.io/docs/guides/open_data.html)
- [Meta data](https://library.bath.ac.uk/research-data/working-with-data/data-documentation-metadata)
- [FAIR principle](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/)
- [Reproducible work flow](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021)
- [Version control](https://github.com/DCS-training/VersionControl)
- [Preregistration and registered reports](https://github.com/DCS-training/Digital-Method-of-the-Month/blob/main/DMM%20Docs/Preregistration.md)


## Timing

You can use open research practices at any point in your research flow. For example, you could:

1. Document your study design
2. Pre-register your study or submit a registered report
3. Openly share your research data (with good documentation)
4. Keep versions of data analysis or other code and make these openly accessible
5. Publish your papers open access, or upload your manuscripts on a pre-print server (or even your own personal website) if you cannot afford APC

It's important to be aware that engaging in open research practices *will* have timing implications for your work. We'll talk more about these in the session, but the take-home message is that to do good open research, you will probably need to frontload a lot of the hard thinking and decision making. Certain tasks may also take more time than you're used to e.g. documenting your code so it can be understood by someone else is usually a lot more involved than documenting it just for your future self!


## Easy pitfalls

- Additional time commitment throughout the workflow
- Changing your mind about study design/data analysis after pre-registration
- Understanding requirements for a reproducible workflow e.g. random seeds, sample sizes
- Permissions and anonymising data for sharing
- Journal selection (paywalls and publication fees)
- Remembering that open research is not a silver bullet, and it is not all-or-nothing
