# Digital-Method-of-the-Month

In this repository you are going to find the documents we produced to support the discussion in our **Digital Methods of the Month**.
These documents will help you orienting yourself if you want to pickup the method in your research.

These informal 1-hour meetings are a safe space to freely discuss the practicalities of learning and implementing a new digital skill in your research.

Each month we select a method, and we have a practical discussion on what it takes to learn and master the method.

- What this method is really about?
- How much time will it take to get the basics?
- What are the software options available?
- What are the most common pitfalls?
- Where can you find more info on the subject?

Please check our [website](http://www-staging.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/training/digital-method-month) to see what the upcoming meetings will be.
